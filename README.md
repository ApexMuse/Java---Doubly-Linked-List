# Java---Doubly-Linked-List
Implementation of a Doubly-Linked List in Java

This was an assignment for a Data Structures course.

Assignment:

"In this assignment, you are going to implement doubly-linked list (DLL) of object Person discussed 
 in class (refer to the slides for the basic structure).
 
 Your code should have all basics operation implemented, including insertion a node, delete a node, 
 searching and printing by a specific key (such as last name).
 
 You should first construct a DLL of at least 20 nodes, this is done by consecutive applications of 
 operation InsertFront(). Then demonstrate other operations. All the demonstrations must be able to 
 be observed during a single run (that is, you cannot restart your program in order to demonstrate a 
 single operation)."
